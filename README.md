HTTPSify 
========
A `Let'sEncrypt` based reverse proxy, that will automatically generate &amp; renew valid `ssl` certs for your domains, it also enables the `http/2` protocol by default, and uses `roundrobin` as an algorithm to loadbalance the incoming requests between multiple `upstreams`, as well as redirecting the traffic from `http` traffic to `https` just if you enabled the flag `--redirect`.


# Quick Start

### # Using Docker
> Just run the following and then have fun !!
```bash
$ docker run --network host -v ~/.httpsify:/.httpsify -p 443:443 ghcr.io/alash3al/httpsify
```

## # From Binaries
> Go to [releases page](https://github.com/alash3al/httpsify/releases)

### # Building from source
> You must have the `Go` environment installed
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/alash3al/httpsify
```

### # Configurations
> Goto your `$HOME` Directory and edit the `hosts.json` to something like this
```json
{
	"example1.com": ["localhost:9080"],
	"example2.com": ["localhost:8080", "localhost:8081"]
}
```
> As you see, the configuration file accepts a `JSON` object/hashmap of `domain` -> `upstreams`,
and yes, it can load-balance the requests between multiple upstreams using `roundrobin` algorithm.

> Also, You don't need to restart the server to reload the configurations, because `httpsify` automatically watches the
configurations file and reload it on any change.
